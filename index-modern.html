                        <p>Sal Sanfilippo was born and raised in Boston. He received a BA in English from UMass Boston and an MBA from Suffolk Universityâ€”later, as an airline executive, he lived in Italy, Australia, and California. But the dream to write and share stories about the nobility and frailty of the human condition was never far from his heart.</p>

                        <p>With "Through the Dog's Eyes," his first novel, published in 2022, he touched readers around the world, offering insight into the unique bond between humans and the precious dogs that choose us as their own.</p>

                        <p>In March of 2023, the book was featured on "NightSide with Dan Rae," a nationally syndicated radio program heard across the United States. <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/episode/through-the-dog-s-eyes-10-p-m--53355674" target="_blank">Listen to the podcast here</a>.</p>

                        <p>In Sal's second novel, "They Never Stop Loving You," Sal continues to explore the value to be found in a simple life well lived and the impact we all have on those we touch on our journey through this sometimes challenging and confusing world.</p>

                        <h3>About "They Never Stop Loving You"</h3>
                        <p>Miriam thinks she has all the answers until she meets AJ, a kindly old man and his oversized bear of a dog. Miriam's convinced love is a fantasy for the weak. But AJ's tale of young Tony Miracolo and the people who love him opens her eyes to a different world.</p>

                        <p>Tony's simple plea to his parents, "Can I have a dog?" seems harmless enough. But his vow to free a battered dog from a terrible existence will forever change him while putting the lives of those most dear to him at risk. Not all tales have a storybook ending, and ultimately, the reader must decide. But in the end, They Never Stop Loving You speaks to what matters most in life and the true meaning of family.</p>

                        <p>Woven throughout Sal's work, you'll find at their core, stories detailing the decency he sees in the human experience and the difference having a loving dog by our side can have for us all.</p>

                        <p>From the beginning, Sanfilippo ensconces us in the mind of Bull, a 120-pound Newfie mix, whose love for his family, his neighbors and anything edible that lands on the floor is unconditional. Most of all though, he loves Jake, his special boy, and it is Jake's life we watch unfold through Bull's gentle and protective eyes. This story will have you smiling, crying and smiling again through your tears.</p>

                        <h3>An ideal book for dog lovers, heartfelt and emotional</h3>
                        <p>I really enjoyed this book. It has its exhilarating moments but it also brought me to tears several times in a very good, emotional way. Sanfilippo's writing is clean and skillful. Writing from the dog's point of view is engaging and kept me turning the pages. This book is much more than a story about a dog. It's also about the boy's (Jake) coming-of-age story and a love story. This truly is a memorable feel-good novel that stays with you.</p>

                        <p>A heartwarming story of friendship, family and the unconditional love between a (my) boy and his dog, Bull. This book brought back so many memories of days gone by, the joy of growing up surrounded by family, friends, caring neighbors, and of course the one constant, my dog. Thank you Jake, Bull, and Sal, for sharing your story. Wonderful first book.</p>
